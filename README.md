# Dashboards
Here you can find all my work
I made a dashboard that can be used in a tourism office as an interactive display to help people visiting the town decide where to eat. Possible uses the dashboard needs to support:
1. Idea of the types of food they could try in the town.
2. Find a restaurant to eat at.
3. Determine the quality of the restaurant.
4. Make a reservation and determine how to get to the restaurant.  Thanks to ** T.James ** for her insights on this project.
