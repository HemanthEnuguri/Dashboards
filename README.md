# Dashboards
Here you can find all my work. I will try to give brief description about all my dashboards over here.

1. YELP:
I made a dashboard that can be used in a tourism office as an interactive display to help people visiting the town decide where to eat. Possible uses the dashboard needs to support:
 Idea of the types of food they could try in the town.
 Find a restaurant to eat at.
 Determine the quality of the restaurant.
 Make a reservation and determine how to get to the restaurant.  Thanks to ** T.James ** for her insights on this project.

2. NETFLIX DASHBOARD:
In the Netflix dashboard, I showcased the categorization of movies by title, genre, and ratings. Additionally, I provided an overview of the overall distribution of movies and TV shows, highlighting the distribution across different countries. The dashboard also features a user-friendly drag-and-drop functionality, enabling users to select and filter content based on rating, genre, date added, and release year with ease.

3.FINANCIAL TIMES FOR ACC UNIVERSITIES:
I also developed another dashboard centered around teaching scores for a university, organized by year. This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the teaching performance over different academic years, allowing for effective analysis and insights into the trends and patterns associated with the teaching scores.
